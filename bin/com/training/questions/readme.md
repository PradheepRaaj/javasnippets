1. Hour glass
 
This one is playing with the 2D array.
You can List of lists for 2D array for better logical construction
	
	Given a  2D Array, arr:
		1 1 1 0 0 0
		0 1 0 0 0 0
		1 1 1 0 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0
		0 0 0 0 0 0
	An hourglass in A is a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in arr's graphical representation:
		a b c
		  d
		e f g
	There are 16 hourglasses in arr. An hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr , then print the maximum hourglass sum. The array will always be 6 X 6.
